                  The day was April 8<sup>th</sup> 2024 and 8 coders were working "quietly" at LaunchCode HQ.  
                  So it all started one day. When the sun and the moon met...
                  during business hours. And we decided as a collective to go on an adventure.
                  Some of us were scared, but we were drawn to the energy. It's a "once in a lifetime event"... every
                  few years. We go outside, Matt gives us the glasses, everyone is looking at the sun.
                  I do want to acknowledge... Kyle was doing his own things. Matt pointed out that if you look at the
                  shadows of the leaves. And that once the moon moved past the sun. It was in that moment that we
                  realized
                  that we have forged a brotherhood for life.

                  Now we had to take another photo because Kyle was doing his own thing. So we got it together and took
                  a final group photo. And then a discord channel was born afte that and we have been going strong ever
                  since. Join us for the next happy hour. Tuesday May 14th.

                  This is the right side of the text and I want to make sure that we have enough room. I find everyone
                  so interesting.
                  Where is this going? I am just trying to make enough room for the good stuff. It looks like its
                  balaning now as long
                  as there is enough text.
